[prework submission](https://github.com/Marvinesc3/codepath-cybersecurity-pre-work-2022/blob/main/prework_cybersec.png)

To complete this project, I:
1. Configured FireFox browser to work with Burp
2. Monitored network traffic through Burp
3. Launched a brute force sniper attack on simple blog login page
4. Found username and password combinations that received different server responses from other requests
5. Logged in successfully to blog and posted submission onto GitHub
