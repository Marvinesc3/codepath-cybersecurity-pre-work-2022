To complete this project, I did the following:
1. Configured FireFox browser to work with Burb
2. Monitored network traffic through Burp
3. Launched a brute force sniper attack on simple blog login page
4. Found username and password combinations that received different server responses from other requests
5. Posted submission onto GitHub
